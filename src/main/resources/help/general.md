# CS108-PET Help

This help text refers to cs108-pet (cs108 Performance Evaluation Tool) version 2.0.0.

## Be Quick

To be quick and efficient, 
`pet` always remembers your last course / catalogue tuple.
Thus, one can directly open the catalogue
(without having to manually load the course beforehand)
or open group (Shortcut: Ctrl+O) to start working.

We store this so-called _session_ in a JSON file at `<userhome>/.cs108pet/session.json`

## Revert Assessment

To revert a once made assessment
 (e.g. because it was accidentally clicked),
**right-click** on the label.

E.g. To revert the requirement 'A', 
one has to **right-click** on the points of requirement 'A'
